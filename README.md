# PoC_Team_A_LangGraph

## APPROACH:
I followed simple approach , get the django github Url from user . Containerize it to access the app at localhost port 8000 . Now Created a python script that will fetch the source code the page . Then give this source code to LLM to generate functional spects.md . The good thing about this md file is we will get User Interaction flow with their URL. The Reason of doing this is sometImes the Llm generates random url so we use source code to access the actual path. Now In the next step- The python script will get each url one by one from readme , access itâ€™s source code and give this source code to LLM to generate test_cases , at the end we will execute test cases , and generate sepearte report for each page .
